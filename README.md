# hello-world
A trial usage of GitHub (Tutorial)

We are going to see the benefits of using a BRANCH in order to make an editable copy of the program you are working on. A copy allows for a second platform for edits of the project to be made.

1) This allows you to save multiple versions of a base file (Inefficient? Copy pasting essentially; maybe bad practice)
2) Allows you to change and test new code before saving

N.B. You must remember to COMMIT the file and save it for it to affect the master documentation.
